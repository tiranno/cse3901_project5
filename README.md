JavaScript Calculator

Overview: 
To use the calculator click on the buttons diplayed with your cursor to send
input into the calculator. Press the "=" button to calculate your expression.

The expression that is input by the user has to be completely balenced. For 
example, an expression with unbalenced parenthesis will not yield a result. 
Thus it is assumed that the user entered a correct experession. The calculator
is not responsible for any results that come from such an attempt or what 
comes thereafter.


Power Functions:
To use the squared function simply press the "x^2" button after entering a number
to square a number. To use the power function enter a number and press the "y^n"
button. Then enter the exponent you wish to use then click ok.


Trig Functions:
To run the trig functions you click on the trig function of your choice, 
then enter the number you want to be evaluated. you must enter the number
throught the keyboard. clicking the number in the number pad will not work. 
 

History:
History displays the last 7 inputs in chronologically order from newest to oldest. 
Input buttons next to history lines allow a memory function to input these values into the input.
After you enter your number (and it must be a number, not an expression) 
hit ok and you will see the trig function with your input appear in the equation. 
once you hit '=' the trig functions will be evaluated and the result 
will be in radians. Degrees is not an option on our calcualtor. 

Other:
In case it was of any confusion, the "%" on the calculator is the modulo/remainder
operator, not a percentage calculator.
